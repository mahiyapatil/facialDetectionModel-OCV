# facialDetectionModel-OCV
First legitimate ai/py project. Realized my cs skills are not as futile as presumed.

Utilizes accuracy percentage to classify faces with precise deviation from image used in processing (stored under faces file).
- multiple faces can be detected in singular frame
- restricted to particular angles (enough data cannot be gathered at times in blurred/distorted angles for accurate facial identification)
- utilizes *specifically* pip install dlib version --> 19.22
- face match threshold for how accurate the face is to img stored for img processing purposes
- opencv-python
- face_recognition package
- dlib
